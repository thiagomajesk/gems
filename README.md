# What's GEMS?

GEMS (Gaming Ecosystem of Modular Shards) is a toolkit for building [Persistent Browser-Based Games](#whats-a-pbbg) by providing an opinionated backbone that simplifies the creation of community-driven experiences. GEMS uses a data-driven approach that allows for customization via configuration and extensibility through scripts.

## What's a PBBG?

A Persistent Browser-Based Game (PBBG) is an online game you can play in your web browser that keeps going even when you're not logged in. Players can make progress, gather resources, and influence the game world over time. This type of game combines elements of strategy and adventure, allowing you to return later and see how your actions have shaped the game. It’s designed for anyone looking for a fun and engaging experience without needing to be a hardcore gamer.

## Development

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
